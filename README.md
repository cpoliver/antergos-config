# antergos-config

This is a repo to eventually store my Antergos/Arch linux install scripts and config.

## Hints & Tips

  - To set wallpaper with more settings (tile, centre, stretch), open an image in firefox and set the wallpaper from there.
  - For configuring multi-monitor arragements, use ARandR instead of the built-in display settings
